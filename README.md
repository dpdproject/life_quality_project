## About the Project

The project is a simple single-page application to discover the life quality scores of cities around the world, thanks to the
[Teleport](https://developers.teleport.org/api/) APIs.

Statistics included in the project are the Housing score, the Cost of Living score and the total score of the city on a scale from 0 to 100, with a
brief description of the city itself.
